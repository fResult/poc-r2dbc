# POC R2DBC

This repository is a parallel project to [Learning Webflux 3.0 (module `kotlin.06-data-access`)](https://github.com/fResult/Learn-Spring-Webflux-3.0/tree/main/kotlin/06-data-access) and is used for learning R2DBC with Spring WebFlux.

It was created separately because the original repository had connection issues with the R2DBC driver.\
This repository serves as a proof of concept (POC) to explore and test the R2DBC setup more reliably.
