# POC R2DBC

This repository is for learning R2DBC with Spring Webflux parallel to the [Learning Webflux 3.0 repository](https://github.com/fResult/Learn-Spring-Webflux-3.0) on module `kotlin.06-data-access`.\
Because running on that repository, there are some issues with database could not be connected by R2DBC driver, so I create this repository to POC it parallel.
